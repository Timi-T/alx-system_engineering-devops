A server is a software or a hardware whose job is to process requests from clients on a specific network (local or internet).

The domain name is a name that acts as the human friendly address of a computer in network.

The "www" in www.foobar.com is a CNAME (canonical name).

The role of a web server primarily is to provide static web pages or files to a client on a network.

The role of an application server is to perform a business logic on data goten from a client.

The role of the database is to store relavant data.

The server uses the HTTP protocol to communicate with clients requesting a website.

ISSUES WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE

1. SPOF - known as a single point of failure is a point in a a network that if faulty can cause the whole sytem to fail.
in the design of this infrastructure, we use just one server for the web, application and datebase server. If this server fils then the whole system fails.

2. In our design here, the system is not redundant i.e it is not relicated on any other servers so deploying a new code would mean that the server has to be unavailable for the period of update.

3. This design cannot scale if we have too much incoming traffic because we have all the services on just one server.
