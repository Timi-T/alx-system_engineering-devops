In this new infrastructure, we add a new server to make our service redundant. Basically we have replicated our service on another server by adding a new web server, a new application server, 1 load balancer, our codebase and a new database.
The load balancer which is a new component to the whole infrastructure is there to direct traffic to the available servers. The load balancer uses a round robin algorithm. the algorithm basically directs traffic in a sequencial manner.
The load balancer uses the Active-Active setup which makes use of both servers at the same time to increase performance and reduce load on one server.
The Active-passive setup uses just one server for the workload and keeps the other as a backup incase of failure.

A primary-replica cluster makes use of differnt instances of a database where we have one primary and a replica of the primary. The replica gets updated after the primary gets updated.

The primary node of an application is the active node while the replica is the passive node.

For this design we have the load balancer as a single point of failure.

we have no firewalls in this design, making it open to anyone to access the servers. also we have no secure sockets layer making it an untrusted network.

without monitoring, if a server breaks down, the load balancer is not aware and keeps routing incoming traffic to the server.
