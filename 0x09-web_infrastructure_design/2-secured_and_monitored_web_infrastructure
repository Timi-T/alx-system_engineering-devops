3 firewalls are added to protect the servers from unwanted traffic.
one for the load balancer
another for the first instance of the service
and a third firewall for the second instance of the service

The SSL certificate serves as a proof of authenticity of the web service.

We have included a data collector, a web server monitor and an application server monitor to monitor the performances of each component.

The firewalls are a system in place to filter unwanted traffic into a network.

the traffic is served over https to secure data between the users and the web service.

The monitoring is used to keep track of the servers performance.

ISSUES WITH THIS INFRASTRUCTURE
1. Terminating SSL at the load balancer level is dangerous because the data is decripted before getting to the specific server it is meant for which leaves a gap in the security of the whole network.

2. Having just one server accepting writes is a problem because it puts a lot of load on a specific server and if that server fails, there might be a data gap between the replica and the primary.
